# An App for diagnosing severity of chronic kidney disease.
This app provides a novel approach to diagnose the severity of chronic kidney disease. The app is a custom camera application   which takes a high-quality image of a special test strip which changes color according to the concentration of creatinine in the blood.  This image is then transferred to a machine learning system which analyzes the image and predicts the severity of kidney disease. Key challenges include working with the camera while localizing the test strip and guiding the user to hold the phone properly such as a high-quality image can be captured.
